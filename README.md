A repository fork from LokiTheCuteBear RetopoView which focus on making the essential code works with the newly independent Blender Vulkan graphics api, since OpenGL Wrapper (bgl) is deprecated in 3.4

There are things that is changed in this fork to make the code simpler and can be repurposed for general usage also safer for future api changes:
1. removed keymap functionality
2. removed pie-menu functionality
3. hot loops optimizatin for performance stability
4. lesser computational iteration for performance stability
